2
00:01:56,574 --> 00:01:58,708
Yes?

3
00:02:00,645 --> 00:02:02,712
For you, my lady.

4
00:02:21,733 --> 00:02:24,166
How far is Mole's Town?

5
00:02:32,009 --> 00:02:33,509
Sansa.

6
00:02:37,415 --> 00:02:39,248
Lady Brienne.

7
00:02:41,886 --> 00:02:45,187
When I heard you had escaped
Winterfell, I feared the worst.

8
00:02:47,158 --> 00:02:49,425
You have no idea how happy I am

9
00:02:49,527 --> 00:02:51,193
to see you unharmed.

10
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:54,564
Unharmed?

11
00:02:54,666 --> 00:02:56,366
What are you doing here?

12
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:59,335
I rode north with the Knights of
the Vale to come to your aid.

13
00:02:59,437 --> 00:03:02,271
They're encamped at Moat
Cailin as we speak.

14
00:03:02,374 --> 00:03:04,173
To come to my aid?

15
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:08,511
Did you know about Ramsay?

16
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:10,847
If you didn't know, you're an idiot.

17
00:03:10,948 --> 00:03:12,715
If you did know, you're my enemy.

18
00:03:14,085 --> 00:03:16,819
Would you like to hear
about our wedding night?

19
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:21,223
He never hurt my face.

20
00:03:21,325 --> 00:03:24,861
He needed my face, the face
of Ned Stark's daughter.

21
00:03:29,401 --> 00:03:31,934
But the rest of me,

22
00:03:32,036 --> 00:03:34,136
he did what he liked with the rest of me

23
00:03:34,238 --> 00:03:37,540
as long as I could still
give him an heir.

24
00:03:40,445 --> 00:03:42,177
What do you think he did?

25
00:03:46,317 --> 00:03:48,217
I can't begin to contemplate...

26
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:50,319
What do you think he did to me?

27
00:03:58,596 --> 00:04:01,764
Lady Sansa asked you a question.

28
00:04:01,866 --> 00:04:03,332
He beat you.

29
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:04,700
Yes, he enjoyed that.

30
00:04:04,803 --> 00:04:06,302
What else do you think he did?

31
00:04:06,404 --> 00:04:08,571
- Sansa, I...
- What else?

32
00:04:11,242 --> 00:04:12,742
Did he cut you?

33
00:04:14,746 --> 00:04:17,547
- Maybe you did know about Ramsay
all along. - I didn't know.

34
00:04:17,649 --> 00:04:19,549
I thought you knew everyone's secrets.

35
00:04:19,651 --> 00:04:22,985
I made a mistake, a horrible mistake.

36
00:04:23,087 --> 00:04:24,687
I underestimated a stranger.

37
00:04:26,257 --> 00:04:27,757
The other things he did,

38
00:04:27,859 --> 00:04:29,659
ladies aren't supposed to
talk about those things,

39
00:04:29,761 --> 00:04:32,595
but I imagine brothel keepers
talk about them all the time.

40
00:04:35,099 --> 00:04:37,399
I can still feel it.

41
00:04:37,502 --> 00:04:40,636
I don't mean in my tender
heart it still pains me so.

42
00:04:40,738 --> 00:04:44,607
I can still feel what he did in
my body standing here right now.

43
00:04:47,078 --> 00:04:50,145
I'm so sorry.

44
00:04:50,247 --> 00:04:52,147
You said you would protect me.

45
00:04:52,249 --> 00:04:55,785
And I will. You must believe me
when I tell you that I will.

46
00:04:55,887 --> 00:04:59,355
I don't believe you anymore.
I don't need you anymore.

47
00:04:59,457 --> 00:05:01,256
You can't protect me.

48
00:05:01,359 --> 00:05:03,225
You won't even be able
to protect yourself

49
00:05:03,327 --> 00:05:05,595
if I tell Brienne to cut you down.

50
00:05:08,165 --> 00:05:09,565
And why shouldn't I?

51
00:05:12,504 --> 00:05:14,737
Do you want me to beg for my life?

52
00:05:14,839 --> 00:05:17,172
If that's what you want, I will.

53
00:05:19,210 --> 00:05:21,677
Whatever you ask that is in my power,

54
00:05:21,779 --> 00:05:22,979
I will do.

55
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:26,916
What if I want you to die here and now?

56
00:05:28,686 --> 00:05:30,653
Then I will die.

57
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:35,992
You freed me from the monsters
who murdered my family

58
00:05:36,093 --> 00:05:40,129
and you gave me to other
monsters who murdered my family.

59
00:05:41,799 --> 00:05:43,866
Go back to Moat Cailin.

60
00:05:43,968 --> 00:05:46,368
My brother and I will take
back the North on our own.

61
00:05:46,470 --> 00:05:48,004
I never want to see you again.

62
00:05:48,105 --> 00:05:51,340
I would do anything to undo
what's been done to you.

63
00:05:54,311 --> 00:05:56,012
I know that I can't.

64
00:05:58,049 --> 00:06:00,783
Will you allow me to say one
more thing before I go?

65
00:06:03,821 --> 00:06:06,956
Your great-uncle Brynden the Blackfish

66
00:06:07,058 --> 00:06:10,726
has gathered what remains of the
Tully forces and retaken Riverrun.

67
00:06:10,828 --> 00:06:12,962
You might consider seeking him out.

68
00:06:13,064 --> 00:06:16,365
The time may come when you
need an army loyal to you.

69
00:06:16,467 --> 00:06:17,433
I have an army.

70
00:06:17,535 --> 00:06:19,535
Your brother's army.

71
00:06:28,012 --> 00:06:29,078
Half-brother.

72
00:06:58,776 --> 00:07:00,076
You're not ready.

73
00:07:02,413 --> 00:07:05,280
You should go home before it's too late.

74
00:08:01,639 --> 00:08:05,240
You'll never be one of us, Lady Stark.

75
00:08:20,357 --> 00:08:22,124
She has a point.

76
00:08:27,999 --> 00:08:31,600
None of the first Faceless Men
were born to lords and ladies.

77
00:08:31,703 --> 00:08:34,670
They began as slaves in
the mines of Valyria.

78
00:08:34,772 --> 00:08:36,305
Who was the first?

79
00:08:36,407 --> 00:08:37,807
He was no one.

80
00:08:39,143 --> 00:08:42,144
The Many-Faced God taught
him how to shed his face

81
00:08:42,246 --> 00:08:43,879
and how to give the gift.

82
00:08:43,981 --> 00:08:47,416
The man taught others in
exchange for their service.

83
00:08:47,518 --> 00:08:50,953
Many served, many more gifts were given.

84
00:08:51,055 --> 00:08:53,923
Soon all the masters and
overseers were gone

85
00:08:54,025 --> 00:08:56,225
and the Faceless Men fled.

86
00:08:56,327 --> 00:08:58,127
Where did they go?

87
00:08:58,229 --> 00:08:59,829
Here.

88
00:08:59,931 --> 00:09:03,232
They founded the Free City of
Braavos and built this house.

89
00:09:04,635 --> 00:09:07,569
These were the faces they wore in life

90
00:09:07,671 --> 00:09:10,206
when they were not wearing others.

91
00:09:10,307 --> 00:09:13,075
The first Faceless Men.

92
00:09:14,612 --> 00:09:16,411
And now a girl is one of them,

93
00:09:16,513 --> 00:09:18,714
if a girl desires.

94
00:09:20,151 --> 00:09:22,384
A girl has no desires.

95
00:09:29,627 --> 00:09:31,193
Who?

96
00:09:38,669 --> 00:09:41,403
An actress who calls herself Lady Crane.

97
00:09:41,505 --> 00:09:44,373
She performs at the theater
in Sheelba Square.

98
00:09:46,177 --> 00:09:49,111
A girl has been given a second chance.

99
00:09:49,213 --> 00:09:51,413
There will not be a third.

100
00:09:51,515 --> 00:09:53,615
One way or another,

101
00:09:53,717 --> 00:09:56,718
a face will be added to the hall.

102
00:10:20,511 --> 00:10:23,245
Oh, murdered by a boar.

103
00:10:23,347 --> 00:10:25,915
The great big hairy whore.

104
00:10:26,017 --> 00:10:29,584
He dug in his tusks and dug out my guts

105
00:10:29,687 --> 00:10:33,122
and soon I am no more.

106
00:10:33,224 --> 00:10:36,125
Oh, come, Father, in bed you must lie.

107
00:10:36,227 --> 00:10:39,652
I love you, Father. Please don't die.

108
00:10:39,653 --> 00:10:42,898
Shut up, you swine! Cersei, more wine.

109
00:10:44,072 --> 00:10:46,735
I feel the winds of winter as
they lick across the land.

110
00:10:46,838 --> 00:10:50,239
And our son alone on
that cold, cold throne

111
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,474
without a guiding hand.

112
00:10:52,576 --> 00:10:55,845
Who will teach him strength?
Who will teach him grace?

113
00:10:55,947 --> 00:10:59,849
To whom will he turn when it's time to
learn to look darkness in the face?

114
00:10:59,951 --> 00:11:03,518
Ned Stark will do fine.
Now bring me more wine.

115
00:11:08,796 --> 00:11:10,592
What's happened here, then?

116
00:11:10,694 --> 00:11:12,527
He brought you here, Ned Stark,

117
00:11:12,629 --> 00:11:15,030
'cause you're the brightest
fellow in the land.

118
00:11:15,132 --> 00:11:16,698
You should be king of us all

119
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,001
and I should be your Hand.

120
00:11:19,103 --> 00:11:21,337
We men of the North are right good hands

121
00:11:21,438 --> 00:11:23,239
at keeping people lawful.

122
00:11:23,341 --> 00:11:24,974
I'd ask him for permission,

123
00:11:25,076 --> 00:11:27,243
but he smells too bloody awful.

124
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,314
I die! I die!

125
00:11:32,416 --> 00:11:35,584
And here I now must lie.

126
00:11:35,686 --> 00:11:39,288
Oh, woe. Oh, no.

127
00:11:41,025 --> 00:11:45,261
Oh, I am about to go.

128
00:11:47,431 --> 00:11:49,365
Will you stay on as Joffrey's Hand?

129
00:11:49,466 --> 00:11:51,400
The Iron Throne's what I demand.

130
00:11:51,502 --> 00:11:52,401
- You cannot.
- I can.

131
00:11:52,503 --> 00:11:53,402
- You will not.
- I will.

132
00:11:53,504 --> 00:11:55,170
- You dare not.
- I dare yes.

133
00:11:55,273 --> 00:11:57,373
- The line of succession.
- What's that mean?

134
00:11:57,474 --> 00:11:59,241
- The proper progression.
- What's that mean?

135
00:11:59,343 --> 00:12:01,777
- The lawful ascension.
- What's that mean?

136
00:12:13,724 --> 00:12:16,992
So move along, give me my chair

137
00:12:17,094 --> 00:12:19,194
and there won't be no more trouble.

138
00:12:22,499 --> 00:12:25,301
But we had a deal all done and dusted.

139
00:12:25,403 --> 00:12:28,603
I'm starting to think
you can't be trusted.

140
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,950
Save my father.

141
00:12:41,052 --> 00:12:44,486
Truly you should. Killing the
man will do you no good.

142
00:12:44,588 --> 00:12:46,855
- Save him, please.
- Show him mercy.

143
00:12:46,958 --> 00:12:49,458
Show the people what a
good king should be.

144
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,793
Good people, you may all relax.

145
00:12:51,895 --> 00:12:54,029
My father's friend
shall be spared the...

146
00:12:56,902 --> 00:12:59,534
Father! No!

147
00:12:59,636 --> 00:13:02,304
Oh, Father.

148
00:13:11,582 --> 00:13:13,015
Worry not!

149
00:13:13,117 --> 00:13:14,616
All is well.

150
00:13:14,718 --> 00:13:16,618
I have here a decree

151
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:19,488
from my father Tywin Lannister,

152
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,690
the richest man you'll see.

153
00:13:21,792 --> 00:13:24,326
He proclaims me Hand of the King.

154
00:13:24,428 --> 00:13:26,228
The position's mine for life.

155
00:13:26,330 --> 00:13:28,697
And he's given me permission to take

156
00:13:28,799 --> 00:13:30,932
Sansa as my wife.

157
00:13:33,737 --> 00:13:35,770
You'll learn that what I lack in height,

158
00:13:35,980 --> 00:13:38,107
I make up for in appetite.

159
00:13:38,209 --> 00:13:40,575
So let's forget about your plight,

160
00:13:40,677 --> 00:13:42,777
and go rehearse our wedding night.

161
00:13:52,223 --> 00:13:54,990
It's a wart. Two warts.

162
00:13:55,092 --> 00:13:56,925
I've got two fucking warts on my cock.

163
00:13:57,028 --> 00:14:00,862
Well, don't worry, love. They usually
go away in five or six years.

164
00:14:00,964 --> 00:14:04,233
Oh, wash this, darling. It stinks of me.

165
00:14:04,335 --> 00:14:07,569
You can do better, Bianca, dear.
You must do.

166
00:14:07,671 --> 00:14:09,338
I had two lines.

167
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:11,640
There are no small parts.
You rang very false.

168
00:14:11,742 --> 00:14:13,308
I rang very false?

169
00:14:13,411 --> 00:14:16,311
What you need, love, is for
someone to ring you true.

170
00:14:18,215 --> 00:14:20,782
You weren't complaining
about me last night.

171
00:14:20,884 --> 00:14:22,817
May I get you some wine, Lady Crane?

172
00:14:22,920 --> 00:14:24,986
I'm a rum girl, Bobono.

173
00:14:25,089 --> 00:14:27,322
You need to know that if
we're going to be intimate.

174
00:14:27,425 --> 00:14:28,990
Of course we're going to be intimate.

175
00:14:29,093 --> 00:14:31,660
It's only a matter of time.

176
00:14:35,178 --> 00:14:36,365
To our children.

177
00:14:36,467 --> 00:14:38,467
May they have your talent.

178
00:14:38,569 --> 00:14:40,469
And your filthy mind.

179
00:14:47,178 --> 00:14:49,578
A girl will poison the rum.

180
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:51,913
Lady Crane is the only
one who drinks it.

181
00:14:55,919 --> 00:14:59,020
If a girl could use one of
the faces from the hall...

182
00:14:59,123 --> 00:15:01,256
A girl is not ready.

183
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,228
She's a good actress.

184
00:15:06,330 --> 00:15:08,663
So a man has heard.

185
00:15:08,765 --> 00:15:11,600
Seems like a decent woman.

186
00:15:14,605 --> 00:15:18,039
Does death only come for the wicked
and leave the decent behind?

187
00:15:20,177 --> 00:15:21,676
No.

188
00:15:25,416 --> 00:15:26,982
Who wants her dead?

189
00:15:27,084 --> 00:15:29,884
That does not matter.
The price was paid.

190
00:15:31,688 --> 00:15:34,656
The younger actress.

191
00:15:34,758 --> 00:15:38,093
She's jealous because
Lady Crane is better.

192
00:15:38,195 --> 00:15:41,696
A girl must decide if she wants
to serve the Many-Faced God.

193
00:15:43,134 --> 00:15:44,866
A girl has decided.

194
00:15:46,001 --> 00:15:48,604
A servant does not ask questions.

195
00:16:58,175 --> 00:17:00,576
No! No! No!

196
00:17:23,667 --> 00:17:25,967
It was you.

197
00:17:26,069 --> 00:17:27,769
You made the white walkers.

198
00:17:27,871 --> 00:17:30,004
We were at war.

199
00:17:30,107 --> 00:17:32,507
We were being slaughtered.

200
00:17:32,610 --> 00:17:35,043
Our sacred trees cut down.

201
00:17:35,145 --> 00:17:37,846
We needed to defend ourselves.

202
00:17:37,948 --> 00:17:39,448
From whom?

203
00:17:40,277 --> 00:17:42,083
From you.

204
00:17:42,670 --> 00:17:44,386
From men.

205
00:17:53,029 --> 00:17:56,732
We speak in the presence
of the Drowned God.

206
00:17:56,833 --> 00:17:58,900
In his name we gather today

207
00:17:59,002 --> 00:18:02,604
to choose a new king as our leader.

208
00:18:02,706 --> 00:18:04,573
Who makes a claim?

209
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,747
I am Yara Greyjoy,

210
00:18:11,848 --> 00:18:14,249
daughter of Balon Greyjoy,

211
00:18:14,351 --> 00:18:16,585
King of the Iron Islands.

212
00:18:17,921 --> 00:18:19,854
I claim the Salt Throne.

213
00:18:19,956 --> 00:18:22,524
We've never had a queen. Not once.

214
00:18:22,626 --> 00:18:25,059
There are many things we've never done.

215
00:18:25,162 --> 00:18:27,896
We've never made our
mark upon the world.

216
00:18:27,998 --> 00:18:31,433
The great lords of
Westeros pay us no mind

217
00:18:31,535 --> 00:18:34,569
until our little raids buzz
through their kingdoms

218
00:18:34,672 --> 00:18:36,305
long enough to become a nuisance.

219
00:18:36,407 --> 00:18:38,674
Then they swat us down.

220
00:18:38,776 --> 00:18:42,277
They conquer us, humiliate us,

221
00:18:42,379 --> 00:18:44,813
and go right back to
forgetting we exist.

222
00:18:44,915 --> 00:18:46,815
Aye!

223
00:18:46,917 --> 00:18:49,250
- We are a sea people.
- Aye!

224
00:18:49,353 --> 00:18:52,621
- Our god is a sea god.
- Aye!

225
00:18:52,723 --> 00:18:54,856
When I am queen, we will
build a fleet that...

226
00:18:54,958 --> 00:18:56,658
- You shall not be queen!
- I am not finished!

227
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:59,328
Yes, you are! A woman will not lead us.

228
00:18:59,430 --> 00:19:02,764
Not when Balon's own
male heir has returned.

229
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,827
I am Theon Greyjoy...

230
00:19:33,296 --> 00:19:36,197
last living son of Balon Greyjoy.

231
00:19:44,241 --> 00:19:46,842
And she is your rightful ruler.

232
00:19:46,943 --> 00:19:48,176
Aye!

233
00:19:48,278 --> 00:19:49,878
Those of you that have sailed under her,

234
00:19:49,980 --> 00:19:51,880
and there are many of you here,

235
00:19:51,982 --> 00:19:54,583
- you know what she is.
- Aye!

236
00:19:54,685 --> 00:19:55,984
- She is a reaver.
- Aye!

237
00:19:56,086 --> 00:19:58,319
- She is a warrior.
- Aye!

238
00:19:58,422 --> 00:20:00,188
She is ironborn!

239
00:20:00,290 --> 00:20:01,890
Aye!

240
00:20:01,992 --> 00:20:04,559
We will find no better leader.

241
00:20:07,631 --> 00:20:09,431
This is our queen.

242
00:20:14,705 --> 00:20:18,640
Yara! Yara! Yara!

243
00:20:18,742 --> 00:20:21,342
I'm Euron Greyjoy.

244
00:20:21,445 --> 00:20:23,879
I claim the Salt Throne.

245
00:20:23,880 --> 00:20:35,024
[T][U][SUBT][TITULO]

246
00:20:35,025 --> 00:20:36,525
Niece.

247
00:20:38,094 --> 00:20:39,093
Nephew.

248
00:20:40,964 --> 00:20:42,764
Little Theon.

249
00:20:44,435 --> 00:20:47,368
Heard you managed to fuck
things right into the ground.

250
00:20:49,005 --> 00:20:50,872
Captured a castle you couldn't keep.

251
00:20:50,974 --> 00:20:53,975
Got yourself taken prisoner.

252
00:20:54,077 --> 00:20:56,277
Even heard you have no cock.

253
00:21:00,216 --> 00:21:02,551
Explains why you think
a woman can be king.

254
00:21:02,653 --> 00:21:04,419
When did you return, Uncle?

255
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:06,721
A few days ago.

256
00:21:06,824 --> 00:21:09,190
I had some things to take care of.

257
00:21:09,292 --> 00:21:11,059
Long overdue.

258
00:21:12,362 --> 00:21:13,929
I'm glad you're here.

259
00:21:15,999 --> 00:21:19,668
Now I know what my first
act as queen will be.

260
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:22,604
To execute the man who killed my father.

261
00:21:29,045 --> 00:21:30,512
I did.

262
00:21:30,614 --> 00:21:32,747
I killed him.

263
00:21:34,217 --> 00:21:36,818
Threw him right over a rope bridge

264
00:21:36,920 --> 00:21:40,088
and watched him fall.

265
00:21:40,190 --> 00:21:41,857
He was leading us nowhere

266
00:21:41,959 --> 00:21:44,593
and we would still be heading
there if it weren't for me.

267
00:21:44,695 --> 00:21:47,762
No one loved him. No one
wanted to follow him.

268
00:21:47,865 --> 00:21:50,599
He led us into two wars we couldn't win.

269
00:21:50,701 --> 00:21:54,669
I apologize to you all for
not killing him years ago.

270
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,972
That would have been hard to do.

271
00:21:57,073 --> 00:21:59,040
You weren't here.

272
00:21:59,142 --> 00:22:02,711
Last I heard, you were gallivanting
around the world having a grand old time.

273
00:22:02,813 --> 00:22:04,278
Gallivanting?

274
00:22:04,381 --> 00:22:08,718
That the sort of thing you start to say
once your dick gets chopped off?

275
00:22:08,719 --> 00:22:11,553
Did the great lords of Westeros
teach you words like that?

276
00:22:12,923 --> 00:22:14,723
You were gone.

277
00:22:14,825 --> 00:22:16,324
Yara was here.

278
00:22:16,426 --> 00:22:19,127
Being ironborn. Leading ironborn.

279
00:22:19,229 --> 00:22:22,130
Getting ready to bring us back to glory.

280
00:22:22,232 --> 00:22:23,698
And how will she do that?

281
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:28,169
I will build the largest fleet
the world has ever seen.

282
00:22:30,373 --> 00:22:34,576
Right idea, except I'm the one who's
going to build the Iron Fleet

283
00:22:34,678 --> 00:22:36,978
because I'm the one who
knows how to use it.

284
00:22:37,080 --> 00:22:38,547
I've been all over the world.

285
00:22:38,649 --> 00:22:41,983
I've seen more of it than
all of you combined.

286
00:22:42,085 --> 00:22:45,020
And across the sea there is a person

287
00:22:45,121 --> 00:22:48,957
who hates the great lords of
Westeros just as much as we do.

288
00:22:49,059 --> 00:22:51,660
Someone with a large army,

289
00:22:51,762 --> 00:22:55,530
three large dragons, and no husband.

290
00:22:55,632 --> 00:22:57,866
I'm going to build that fleet

291
00:22:57,968 --> 00:23:00,168
and I'm going to gallivant right over

292
00:23:00,270 --> 00:23:02,403
and give it to Daenerys Targaryen

293
00:23:02,505 --> 00:23:04,906
along with my big cock.

294
00:23:05,008 --> 00:23:07,008
You're going to seduce the Dragon Queen?

295
00:23:07,110 --> 00:23:10,344
I'm not going to seduce her. The
Iron Fleet will seduce her.

296
00:23:10,447 --> 00:23:13,247
And together we're going to
take the Seven Kingdoms.

297
00:23:13,349 --> 00:23:16,718
I wasn't born to be king.

298
00:23:16,820 --> 00:23:19,320
I paid the iron price

299
00:23:19,422 --> 00:23:20,889
and here I stand.

300
00:23:22,726 --> 00:23:26,427
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

301
00:23:26,529 --> 00:23:30,465
Euron! Euron! Euron! Euron!

302
00:23:30,567 --> 00:23:32,734
Euron! Euron!

303
00:23:44,281 --> 00:23:49,384
May Euron, your servant, be born
again from the sea as you were.

304
00:23:49,385 --> 00:23:52,453
Bless him with salt.
Bless him with stone.

305
00:23:52,555 --> 00:23:54,455
Bless him with steel.

306
00:23:54,557 --> 00:23:57,191
Listen to the waves. Listen to the god.

307
00:23:57,293 --> 00:24:00,428
He is speaking to us and he says

308
00:24:00,530 --> 00:24:05,566
we shall have no king
but Euron Greyjoy.

309
00:24:05,669 --> 00:24:08,870
Let the sea wash your follies
and your vanities away.

310
00:24:08,972 --> 00:24:11,239
Let the old Euron drown.

311
00:24:11,341 --> 00:24:14,142
Let his lungs fill with seawater.

312
00:24:19,850 --> 00:24:23,118
Let the fish eat the
scales off his eyes.

313
00:24:23,219 --> 00:24:25,787
What is dead may never die,

314
00:24:25,889 --> 00:24:29,524
but rises again harder and stronger.

315
00:25:36,727 --> 00:25:38,860
What is dead may never die.

316
00:25:38,962 --> 00:25:42,197
What is dead may never die.

317
00:25:56,146 --> 00:25:58,579
Where are my niece and nephew?

318
00:26:03,553 --> 00:26:05,686
Let's go murder them.

319
00:26:25,742 --> 00:26:27,942
They stole our best ships.

320
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,246
Won't be enough to save them.

321
00:26:33,049 --> 00:26:35,183
Go back to your homes.

322
00:26:35,285 --> 00:26:37,652
Chop down every tree you can find.

323
00:26:37,754 --> 00:26:40,321
Quarter-saw the timber
and start building.

324
00:26:40,423 --> 00:26:42,490
I want every man bending planks.

325
00:26:42,592 --> 00:26:46,094
I want every woman
spinning flax for sails.

326
00:26:46,196 --> 00:26:48,496
Build me a thousand ships

327
00:26:48,598 --> 00:26:51,065
and I will give you this world.

328
00:27:10,220 --> 00:27:12,987
I banished you twice.

329
00:27:14,357 --> 00:27:17,258
You came back twice.

330
00:27:20,596 --> 00:27:22,496
And you saved my life.

331
00:27:27,137 --> 00:27:29,137
So I can't take you back

332
00:27:29,239 --> 00:27:31,339
and I can't send you away.

333
00:27:33,844 --> 00:27:35,810
You must send me away.

334
00:27:48,859 --> 00:27:50,591
Is there a cure?

335
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:52,994
I don't know.

336
00:27:54,378 --> 00:27:55,964
How long does it take?

337
00:27:56,931 --> 00:27:58,566
I don't know that either.

338
00:27:58,668 --> 00:28:01,069
But I've seen what happens
when it goes far enough.

339
00:28:02,572 --> 00:28:04,205
I'll end things before that.

340
00:28:07,777 --> 00:28:09,878
I'm sorry.

341
00:28:10,947 --> 00:28:12,146
I'm so sorry.

342
00:28:12,249 --> 00:28:14,448
Don't be.

343
00:28:14,550 --> 00:28:17,018
All I've ever wanted was to serve you.

344
00:28:20,190 --> 00:28:22,757
Tyrion Lannister was right.

345
00:28:25,428 --> 00:28:27,996
I love you.

346
00:28:32,369 --> 00:28:34,602
I'll always love you.

347
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:41,209
Good-bye, khaleesi.

348
00:28:46,549 --> 00:28:48,883
Do not walk away from your queen,

349
00:28:48,985 --> 00:28:51,052
Jorah the Andal.

350
00:28:53,156 --> 00:28:55,456
You have not been dismissed.

351
00:28:56,826 --> 00:28:59,193
You pledged yourself to me.

352
00:28:59,296 --> 00:29:02,596
You swore to obey my commands
for the rest of your life.

353
00:29:04,667 --> 00:29:08,236
Well, I command you to find the cure

354
00:29:08,338 --> 00:29:10,871
wherever it is in this world.

355
00:29:13,276 --> 00:29:15,944
I command you to heal yourself

356
00:29:17,205 --> 00:29:19,113
and then return to me.

357
00:29:22,018 --> 00:29:24,752
When I take the Seven Kingdoms,

358
00:29:24,854 --> 00:29:27,322
I need you by my side.

359
00:30:06,129 --> 00:30:09,697
In the last fortnight since
our pact with the Masters,

360
00:30:09,799 --> 00:30:13,101
how many killings have been carried
out by the Sons of the Harpy?

361
00:30:13,203 --> 00:30:14,768
None.

362
00:30:14,871 --> 00:30:17,805
And how many Masters have been
butchered by the free men?

363
00:30:17,907 --> 00:30:20,475
Two, but that was the day of the pact.

364
00:30:20,576 --> 00:30:22,310
Since then, nothing.

365
00:30:22,412 --> 00:30:25,413
So it's safe to say that a
fragile peace has taken hold.

366
00:30:25,515 --> 00:30:26,881
For now.

367
00:30:26,983 --> 00:30:28,883
For now is the best we
get in our profession.

368
00:30:28,985 --> 00:30:30,485
It's not enough.

369
00:30:30,586 --> 00:30:32,387
Considering the city was
on the brink of civil war,

370
00:30:32,489 --> 00:30:33,988
I'd say it's a good start.

371
00:30:34,090 --> 00:30:36,657
It's not enough for
Meereen to have peace.

372
00:30:36,759 --> 00:30:39,227
They need to know Daenerys
is responsible for it.

373
00:30:39,329 --> 00:30:42,096
The Sons of the Harpy have a good story.

374
00:30:42,198 --> 00:30:44,365
Resist the foreign invaders.

375
00:30:44,467 --> 00:30:46,567
Our queen has an even better story.

376
00:30:46,669 --> 00:30:51,339
Mother of Dragons, Breaker
of Chains... all that.

377
00:30:51,441 --> 00:30:53,807
The people know who
brought them freedom.

378
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:56,377
Yes, but do they know who
brought them security?

379
00:30:56,479 --> 00:30:58,513
Who brought about an
end to the violence?

380
00:30:58,614 --> 00:31:01,215
We need someone the people trust,

381
00:31:01,317 --> 00:31:04,718
someone they know cannot
be bought or influenced.

382
00:31:04,820 --> 00:31:07,955
Sounds like quite the hero.
Where would we find him?

383
00:31:08,058 --> 00:31:10,324
Who said anything about "him"?

384
00:31:12,078 --> 00:31:14,701
You stand in the presence of Kinvara,

385
00:31:15,473 --> 00:31:18,482
High Priestess of the
Red Temple of Volantis,

386
00:31:18,875 --> 00:31:20,149
the Flame of Truth,

387
00:31:20,150 --> 00:31:21,540
the Light of Wisdom,

388
00:31:21,897 --> 00:31:25,523
the First Servant of the Lord of Light.

389
00:31:31,686 --> 00:31:35,245
Welcome to Meereen.

390
00:31:37,053 --> 00:31:40,020
That's about the extent of my Valyrian.

391
00:31:45,795 --> 00:31:48,596
Thank you for travelling all this way.

392
00:31:48,698 --> 00:31:52,533
I know from personal experience how
uncomfortable the journey can be.

393
00:31:57,140 --> 00:32:00,274
The truth is we need your help.

394
00:32:00,376 --> 00:32:03,478
We had hoped that we could
somehow persuade you to...

395
00:32:03,580 --> 00:32:05,813
You don't need to persuade me.

396
00:32:05,915 --> 00:32:07,715
I came to help.

397
00:32:07,817 --> 00:32:10,985
Daenerys Stormborn is the
one who was promised.

398
00:32:11,087 --> 00:32:14,955
From the fire she was
reborn to remake the world.

399
00:32:15,057 --> 00:32:17,057
Yes.

400
00:32:17,160 --> 00:32:19,026
She has freed the slaves
from their chains

401
00:32:19,129 --> 00:32:22,663
and crucified the
Masters for their sins.

402
00:32:22,765 --> 00:32:24,532
She did indeed.

403
00:32:24,634 --> 00:32:27,502
Her dragons are fire made flesh,

404
00:32:27,604 --> 00:32:29,437
a gift from the Lord of Light.

405
00:32:29,539 --> 00:32:32,440
But you heard all of this
before, haven't you?

406
00:32:32,542 --> 00:32:34,908
On the Long Bridge of Volantis.

407
00:32:37,180 --> 00:32:40,581
The dragons will purify
nonbelievers by the thousands,

408
00:32:40,683 --> 00:32:43,050
burning their sins and flesh away.

409
00:32:43,153 --> 00:32:47,855
Ideally we'd avoid purifying
too many nonbelievers.

410
00:32:47,957 --> 00:32:50,958
The Mother of Dragons has followers
of many different faiths.

411
00:32:51,060 --> 00:32:54,228
You want your queen to be
worshipped and obeyed.

412
00:32:54,330 --> 00:32:57,131
And while she's gone,
you want her advisors

413
00:32:57,233 --> 00:32:58,899
to be worshipped and obeyed.

414
00:32:59,001 --> 00:33:02,236
I'd settle for obeyed.

415
00:33:02,338 --> 00:33:05,339
I will summon my most eloquent priests.

416
00:33:05,441 --> 00:33:08,042
They will spread the word.

417
00:33:08,144 --> 00:33:11,745
Daenerys has been sent to lead
the people against the darkness

418
00:33:11,847 --> 00:33:15,949
in this war and in the
great war still to come.

419
00:33:16,052 --> 00:33:17,518
That sounds most excellent.

420
00:33:17,620 --> 00:33:20,588
A man named Stannis
Baratheon was anointed

421
00:33:20,690 --> 00:33:23,457
as the chosen one by one
of your priestesses.

422
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:26,394
He, too, had a glorious destiny.

423
00:33:26,496 --> 00:33:29,664
He attacked King's Landing
and was soundly defeated

424
00:33:29,765 --> 00:33:31,865
by the man standing beside me.

425
00:33:31,967 --> 00:33:34,435
Last I had heard, he had
been defeated again,

426
00:33:34,537 --> 00:33:38,706
this time at Winterfell
and this time for good.

427
00:33:38,808 --> 00:33:41,909
We'd be most grateful for any support
you could provide the queen.

428
00:33:42,011 --> 00:33:45,112
I suppose it's hard for a
fanatic to admit a mistake.

429
00:33:45,215 --> 00:33:48,749
Isn't that the whole point
of being a fanatic?

430
00:33:48,851 --> 00:33:51,018
You're always right.

431
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:53,721
Everything is the Lord's will.

432
00:33:54,893 --> 00:33:57,491
Everything is the Lord's will.

433
00:33:57,594 --> 00:34:00,361
But men and women make mistakes.

434
00:34:00,463 --> 00:34:02,396
Even honest servants of the Lord.

435
00:34:02,498 --> 00:34:06,434
And you, an honest servant of the Lord,

436
00:34:06,536 --> 00:34:09,036
why should I trust you to know any more

437
00:34:09,138 --> 00:34:11,004
than the priestess who
counseled Stannis?

438
00:34:11,107 --> 00:34:14,074
My friend has a healthy
skepticism of religion,

439
00:34:14,176 --> 00:34:16,910
but we are all loyal
supporters of the queen.

440
00:34:22,084 --> 00:34:24,017
Everyone is what they are

441
00:34:24,120 --> 00:34:27,821
and where they are for a reason.

442
00:34:27,923 --> 00:34:31,091
Terrible things happen for a reason.

443
00:34:31,725 --> 00:34:34,862
Take what happened to you, Lord
Varys, when you were a child.

444
00:34:36,566 --> 00:34:40,402
If not for your mutilation at the
hand of a second-rate sorcerer,

445
00:34:40,403 --> 00:34:46,941
you wouldn't be here helping the Lord's
Chosen bring his light into the world.

446
00:34:46,942 --> 00:34:50,177
Knowledge has made you powerful.

447
00:34:50,280 --> 00:34:53,381
But there's still so
much you don't know.

448
00:34:55,518 --> 00:34:58,486
Do you remember what
you heard that night

449
00:34:58,588 --> 00:35:02,122
when the sorcerer tossed
your parts in the fire?

450
00:35:04,226 --> 00:35:07,828
You heard a voice call out from
the flames. Do you remember?

451
00:35:10,333 --> 00:35:14,134
Should I tell you what the voice said?

452
00:35:14,236 --> 00:35:17,805
Should I tell you the name
of the one who spoke?

453
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:29,617
We serve the same queen.

454
00:35:29,719 --> 00:35:31,752
If you are her true friend,

455
00:35:31,854 --> 00:35:34,488
you have nothing to fear from me.

456
00:37:24,434 --> 00:37:25,966
What?

457
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:11,739
He saw me, the Night King!

458
00:39:11,841 --> 00:39:14,008
- He saw me!
- He touched you.

459
00:39:15,545 --> 00:39:17,678
I don't know. He was close, but...

460
00:39:17,780 --> 00:39:18,746
He touched you.

461
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:24,117
He knows you are here.
He'll come for you.

462
00:39:24,219 --> 00:39:25,619
But he can't get in.

463
00:39:25,721 --> 00:39:29,256
He can now. His mark is on you.

464
00:39:29,358 --> 00:39:31,324
You must leave, all of you.

465
00:39:35,364 --> 00:39:37,297
Come on, Hodor. Help me with the sledge.

466
00:39:37,399 --> 00:39:39,199
Hodor.

467
00:39:39,301 --> 00:39:41,268
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to.

468
00:39:41,370 --> 00:39:44,271
- The time has come.
- The time for what?

469
00:39:44,373 --> 00:39:47,407
For you to become me.

470
00:39:48,812 --> 00:39:52,692
But am I ready?

471
00:39:52,693 --> 00:39:53,914
No.

472
00:39:55,551 --> 00:39:58,285
We can't defend the
north from the walkers

473
00:39:58,387 --> 00:40:00,120
and the south from the Boltons.

474
00:40:00,222 --> 00:40:02,155
If we want to survive,
we need Winterfell

475
00:40:02,257 --> 00:40:05,059
and to take Winterfell,
we need more men.

476
00:40:08,263 --> 00:40:10,931
Aside from the Starks and the Boltons,

477
00:40:11,033 --> 00:40:13,734
the most powerful houses in the North

478
00:40:13,836 --> 00:40:15,869
are the Umbers, the Karstarks,

479
00:40:15,972 --> 00:40:17,605
and the Manderlys.

480
00:40:17,707 --> 00:40:20,407
The Umbers and the Karstarks

481
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:22,442
have already declared for the Boltons,

482
00:40:22,544 --> 00:40:24,177
so we're not doing so well there.

483
00:40:24,279 --> 00:40:26,914
The Umbers gave Rickon to our enemies.
They can hang.

484
00:40:27,016 --> 00:40:29,249
But the Karstarks declared for Ramsay

485
00:40:29,351 --> 00:40:31,852
without knowing they had another choice.

486
00:40:31,954 --> 00:40:34,287
I beg your pardon, my lady,

487
00:40:34,389 --> 00:40:37,524
but they know that a Stark
beheaded their father.

488
00:40:37,627 --> 00:40:39,660
I don't think we can
count on them either.

489
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:44,031
How well do you know
the North, Ser Davos?

490
00:40:44,133 --> 00:40:45,499
Precious little, my lady.

491
00:40:45,601 --> 00:40:47,735
My father always said
Northerners are different.

492
00:40:47,837 --> 00:40:51,538
More loyal, more
suspicious of outsiders.

493
00:40:51,641 --> 00:40:53,206
They may well be loyal,

494
00:40:53,308 --> 00:40:55,275
but how many rose up against the Boltons

495
00:40:55,377 --> 00:40:57,144
when they betrayed your family?

496
00:40:59,481 --> 00:41:02,082
I may not know the
North, but I know men.

497
00:41:02,184 --> 00:41:04,685
They're more or less the same
in any corner of the world

498
00:41:04,787 --> 00:41:07,688
and even the bravest of
them don't want to see

499
00:41:07,790 --> 00:41:11,091
their wives and children
skinned for a lost cause.

500
00:41:12,183 --> 00:41:14,528
If Jon's going to convince
them to fight alongside him,

501
00:41:14,630 --> 00:41:16,596
they need to believe it's
a fight they can win.

502
00:41:16,699 --> 00:41:19,266
There are more than three
other houses in the North...

503
00:41:19,368 --> 00:41:22,002
Glover, Mormont, Cerwyn,

504
00:41:22,104 --> 00:41:23,704
Mazin, Hornwood.

505
00:41:23,806 --> 00:41:27,407
Two dozen more. Together
they equal all the others.

506
00:41:27,509 --> 00:41:29,476
We can start small and build.

507
00:41:29,578 --> 00:41:32,012
The North remembers.

508
00:41:32,114 --> 00:41:33,580
They remember the Stark name.

509
00:41:33,683 --> 00:41:35,582
People will still risk
everything for it,

510
00:41:35,685 --> 00:41:37,885
from White Harbor to Ramsay's own door.

511
00:41:37,987 --> 00:41:40,187
I don't doubt it.

512
00:41:40,289 --> 00:41:42,389
But Jon doesn't have the Stark name.

513
00:41:42,491 --> 00:41:44,558
No, but I do.

514
00:41:47,462 --> 00:41:50,097
Jon is every bit as much Ned Stark's son

515
00:41:50,199 --> 00:41:51,999
as Ramsay is Roose Bolton's.

516
00:41:52,101 --> 00:41:54,134
And there are also the Tullys.
They're not Northern,

517
00:41:54,236 --> 00:41:57,204
but they will back us against
the Boltons without question.

518
00:41:57,306 --> 00:41:58,839
I didn't know the Tullys
still had an army.

519
00:41:58,941 --> 00:42:02,499
My uncle the Blackfish has reformed
it and retaken Riverrun.

520
00:42:03,331 --> 00:42:04,377
How do you know that?

521
00:42:05,748 --> 00:42:08,749
Ramsay received a raven
before I escaped Winterfell.

522
00:42:10,786 --> 00:42:12,519
That's good.

523
00:42:12,621 --> 00:42:14,621
The Blackfish is a legend.

524
00:42:14,724 --> 00:42:17,124
His support would mean a great deal.

525
00:42:17,226 --> 00:42:20,227
Stark, Tully, a few more houses,

526
00:42:20,329 --> 00:42:22,562
almost starts to look
like a winning side.

527
00:42:24,967 --> 00:42:27,034
I've sworn to protect you, my lady.

528
00:42:27,136 --> 00:42:28,902
You heard them. We need more men

529
00:42:29,004 --> 00:42:30,804
and my uncle has an army.

530
00:42:30,906 --> 00:42:32,439
We can send the Blackfish a raven.

531
00:42:32,541 --> 00:42:34,574
Can't risk Ramsay intercepting it.

532
00:42:34,676 --> 00:42:36,343
It has to be you.

533
00:42:36,445 --> 00:42:38,712
Ride for Riverrun. My
uncle will talk to you

534
00:42:38,814 --> 00:42:40,614
and you'll know how to talk to him.

535
00:42:42,952 --> 00:42:44,384
What is it?

536
00:42:46,188 --> 00:42:48,222
I don't like leaving you here alone.

537
00:42:48,323 --> 00:42:49,623
With Jon?

538
00:42:49,725 --> 00:42:52,492
Not him. He seems trustworthy.

539
00:42:52,594 --> 00:42:54,594
A bit brooding, perhaps.

540
00:42:54,696 --> 00:42:56,764
I suppose that's
understandable, considering.

541
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:00,367
The others, though.

542
00:43:02,537 --> 00:43:06,173
Davos and the Red Woman helped
a man murder his own brother

543
00:43:06,275 --> 00:43:07,875
with bloodmagic.

544
00:43:07,977 --> 00:43:10,577
And when Stannis paid for
his crime, where were they?

545
00:43:10,679 --> 00:43:14,882
Already out looking for a
leader with better prospects.

546
00:43:14,984 --> 00:43:17,417
And that wildling fellow
with the beard...

547
00:43:17,519 --> 00:43:20,754
Jon isn't Tormund. Jon
isn't Davos, the Red Woman

548
00:43:20,856 --> 00:43:23,857
or Stannis for that matter. Jon is Jon.

549
00:43:23,959 --> 00:43:27,427
He's my brother. He'll keep me safe.
I trust him.

550
00:43:29,899 --> 00:43:33,834
Then why did you lie to him when he asked
you how you learned about Riverrun?

551
00:43:43,045 --> 00:43:44,711
New dress?

552
00:43:44,814 --> 00:43:47,547
I made it myself. Do you like it?

553
00:43:47,649 --> 00:43:51,651
Yeah, it's... I like the wolf bit.

554
00:43:51,753 --> 00:43:55,856
Good, because I made this for you.

555
00:43:58,560 --> 00:44:00,861
I made it like the one
Father used to wear.

556
00:44:02,217 --> 00:44:03,864
As near as I can remember.

557
00:44:05,634 --> 00:44:07,334
Thank you, Sansa.

558
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:09,102
You're welcome.

559
00:44:29,325 --> 00:44:31,758
Don't knock it down while I'm gone.

560
00:44:31,861 --> 00:44:33,793
I'll do my best.

561
00:44:39,813 --> 00:44:41,335
Good luck.

562
00:45:12,467 --> 00:45:15,002
Should we close the
gate, Lord Commander?

563
00:45:15,104 --> 00:45:17,204
I'm not the Lord Comman...

564
00:45:22,101 --> 00:45:25,913
yeah... close the bloody gate.

565
00:45:37,893 --> 00:45:39,659
We can go home now, Hodor.

566
00:45:40,405 --> 00:45:42,329
Well, maybe not home home,

567
00:45:42,431 --> 00:45:44,631
but somewhere that isn't a cave.

568
00:45:44,733 --> 00:45:46,133
Hodor.

569
00:45:46,235 --> 00:45:48,268
Eat something that isn't moss.

570
00:45:50,505 --> 00:45:52,806
I want an egg. How do you like 'em?

571
00:45:52,908 --> 00:45:55,842
Boiled? Fried up with some butter?

572
00:45:56,697 --> 00:45:58,514
Hodor.

573
00:45:58,515 --> 00:46:01,214
With a rasher of bacon
and some blood sausage.

574
00:46:01,317 --> 00:46:02,615
Hodor.

575
00:47:02,871 --> 00:47:04,777
Get Bran and run!

576
00:47:17,092 --> 00:47:19,026
Bran. Bran, wake up.

577
00:47:19,128 --> 00:47:22,162
- Bran.
- Hodor. Hodor.

578
00:47:22,264 --> 00:47:23,796
Bran, wake up.

579
00:47:33,875 --> 00:47:36,443
Gods keep you on the kingsroad.
Take it easy.

580
00:47:36,545 --> 00:47:37,677
Watch yourself.

581
00:47:40,916 --> 00:47:42,115
Hodor.

582
00:47:42,217 --> 00:47:44,184
Hodor. Hodor.

583
00:47:45,687 --> 00:47:46,753
Help me!

584
00:48:06,208 --> 00:48:07,374
Go!

585
00:48:08,444 --> 00:48:09,943
Go!

586
00:48:57,159 --> 00:48:59,426
Remember that you are a Stark.

587
00:48:59,528 --> 00:49:02,859
Comport yourself with
dignity at the Vale

588
00:49:02,860 --> 00:49:04,364
and try to stay out of fights.

589
00:49:04,466 --> 00:49:06,833
Yes, Father.

590
00:49:08,036 --> 00:49:10,175
But if you have to fight,

591
00:49:10,176 --> 00:49:11,331
win.

592
00:49:13,142 --> 00:49:16,943
Bran! Bran, wake up!

593
00:49:27,695 --> 00:49:30,323
Bran! Bran! Bran, wake up.

594
00:49:30,425 --> 00:49:33,193
- Bran! Bran, wake up!
- Hodor. Hodor.

595
00:49:39,134 --> 00:49:40,333
You have to wake up.

596
00:49:40,435 --> 00:49:42,669
- We need Hodor.
- Hodor. Hodor.

597
00:49:42,771 --> 00:49:44,404
Bran, we need Hodor.

598
00:49:44,506 --> 00:49:46,906
Bran, you have to wake up.
We need Hodor.

599
00:49:49,774 --> 00:49:51,278
Hodor. Hodor.

600
00:50:00,155 --> 00:50:01,754
Bran, we're all going to die!

601
00:50:01,856 --> 00:50:03,490
Bran, wake up!

602
00:50:03,592 --> 00:50:07,060
We're all going to die! Bran! Bran!

603
00:50:07,162 --> 00:50:08,995
Bran, you have to wake up.
We need Hodor.

604
00:50:09,097 --> 00:50:10,664
Hodor. Hodor.

605
00:50:10,765 --> 00:50:12,999
Warg into Hodor now!

606
00:50:13,101 --> 00:50:15,168
Bran, wake up. We need Hodor.

607
00:50:15,270 --> 00:50:18,371
We need Hodor. Warg into Hodor now!
Now!

608
00:50:18,473 --> 00:50:20,507
Listen to your friend, Brandon.

609
00:50:21,876 --> 00:50:23,710
Hodor. Hodor.

610
00:50:23,812 --> 00:50:25,612
Hodor. Hodor.

611
00:50:25,714 --> 00:50:27,814
Hodor. Hodor.

612
00:51:02,551 --> 00:51:05,585
- Summer!
- Go.

613
00:51:05,687 --> 00:51:07,254
Go!

614
00:51:45,067 --> 00:51:46,459
The time has come.

615
00:51:49,097 --> 00:51:51,398
Leave me.

616
00:52:17,125 --> 00:52:19,258
- What are you doing?
- Go!

617
00:53:08,410 --> 00:53:10,443
Hodor, hurry!

618
00:53:10,545 --> 00:53:11,478
Hodor!

619
00:53:30,499 --> 00:53:32,198
Hold the door!

620
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:34,667
Hold the door!

621
00:53:38,172 --> 00:53:40,006
Hold the door!

622
00:53:42,243 --> 00:53:44,677
Hold the door!

623
00:53:52,721 --> 00:53:54,721
Hold the door!

624
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:03,262
Hold the door! Wylis!

625
00:54:03,364 --> 00:54:05,031
What's the matter?

626
00:54:05,133 --> 00:54:07,867
- Hold the door!
- Come on, son.

627
00:54:07,969 --> 00:54:09,602
Hold the door!

628
00:54:15,444 --> 00:54:19,278
Hold the door! Hold the door!

629
00:54:19,380 --> 00:54:22,749
Hold the door! Hold the door!

630
00:54:22,851 --> 00:54:24,818
Hold the door!

631
00:54:24,920 --> 00:54:26,820
Hold the door!

632
00:54:54,683 --> 00:54:57,083
Hold the door! Hold the door!

633
00:54:57,185 --> 00:54:59,819
Hold the door! Hold the door!

634
00:54:59,921 --> 00:55:02,622
Hold the door! Hold the door!

635
00:55:02,724 --> 00:55:05,324
Hold the door! Hold the door!

636
00:55:05,426 --> 00:55:08,094
Hold the door! Hold door!

637
00:55:08,196 --> 00:55:10,530
Hold door! Hold the door!

638
00:55:10,632 --> 00:55:14,868
Hold the door! Hold door! Hold door!

639
00:55:14,970 --> 00:55:17,770
Hold door! Hodor!

640
00:55:17,873 --> 00:55:20,540
Hodor! Hodor!

641
00:55:20,642 --> 00:55:23,209
Hodor! Hodor!

642
00:55:23,311 --> 00:55:24,711
Hodor!
